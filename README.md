Nowadays there is a lot of information in the Web. For this reason, getting to the right information is becoming a challenge.
This work presents the opportunity of using API of several websites which are the main source of different academic publications as a tool to achieve the wanted information.
This method serves also as a filter to eliminate the useless information and is focused only on the academic materials. 
During this work several sources that serve the data through API have been included.
